      <h2>Food Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Surabaya’s food culture is known for its bold and spicy flavors, where sambal (chili paste) is almost always present on the table. The cuisine reflects a blend of influences from Javanese, Madurese, Chinese, and Arab traditions, making it rich and diverse. Portions are usually generous and hearty, matching the lively and outspoken character of the people of Surabaya.
